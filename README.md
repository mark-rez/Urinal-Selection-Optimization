# Urinal-Selection-Optimization
This repository presents a theory and algorithm for determining the optimal position in an occupied row of urinals, with the goal of maximising privacy and minimising discomfort. The theory considers factors such as 
1. the proximity of occupied urinals 
2. the number of neighbouring urinals 
3. the relative distance to the centre of the row. 

By optimising the spatial arrangement, the approach ensures a comfortable and efficient use of public toilet facilities.
